# WiDS Datathon 2026 - Wildfire Evacuation Zone Impact Prediction

This repository contains the analysis and modeling pipeline for the **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide Global Datathon 2026**, focusing on predicting when wildfires will impact evacuation zones.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Predict the probability that a wildfire will threaten an evacuation zone (come within 5 kilometers) at multiple time horizons: 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the initial 5-hour observation period.

**Challenge Type**: Survival Analysis with Censored Data - Multi-Horizon Probability Forecasting
