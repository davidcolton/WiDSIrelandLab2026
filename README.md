# WiDS Datathon 2026 - Wildfire Evacuation Zone Impact Prediction

This repository contains the analysis and modeling pipeline for the **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide Global Datathon 2026**, focusing on predicting when wildfires will impact evacuation zones.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Predict the probability that a wildfire will threaten an evacuation zone (come within 5 kilometers) at multiple time horizons: 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the initial 5-hour observation period.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- uv (recommended) or pip

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WiDSIrelandLab2026.git
cd WiDSIrelandLab2026

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

### Running the Analysis

See the detailed documentation in [`ai_approach/README.md`](ai_approach/README.md) for complete instructions on running the analysis notebooks.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Survival Analysis**: Proper handling of censored data (~50% censoring rate)
- **Multi-Horizon Forecasting**: Predictions at 12h, 24h, 48h, and 72h
- **Feature Engineering**: 70+ engineered features from 34 original features
- **Model Ensemble**: Kaplan-Meier, Cox PH, and Random Survival Forest
- **Monotonicity Enforcement**: Ensures prob_12h ≤ prob_24h ≤ prob_48h ≤ prob_72h

## 🎯 Results

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Random Survival Forest
- **Primary Metric**: Hybrid Score = 0.3 × C-index + 0.7 × (1 - Weighted Brier Score)
- **Evaluation**: C-index (Concordance Index) for ranking quality

### Key Findings
- **Top Predictors**: Distance metrics, growth rates, and domain-specific features
- **Feature Importance**: Distance to evacuation zone is the strongest predictor
- **Censoring Handling**: Survival analysis properly accounts for ~50% censored observations
- **Multi-Horizon Predictions**: Calibrated probabilities at 12h, 24h, 48h, and 72h time horizons

### Operational Impact
- **Evacuation Prioritization**: Rank which communities need warnings first
- **Resource Deployment**: Guide allocation of firefighting crews and aircraft
- **Risk Communication**: Provide calibrated probabilities for threshold-based decisions
- **Time-Bound Forecasts**: Actionable predictions for emergency response planning
